* My default settings for emacs
Let's face it, emacs is a horrible editor out-of-the-box. Therefore I took 
the time to put together a config file to quickly setup and run Emacs.

** What you will need to download
if you dont have any of these make sure to download them or company will
not run as intended.
- clang :: sudo apt install clang
- cmake :: sudo apt install cmake
- libclang-dev :: sudo apt install libclang-dev 

** Packages
1. spaceline
2. company
3. company-irony
4. irony
5. spacemacs-theme
6. use-package

** Handy shortcuts
To use the terminal inside emacs, use: *C-c s*. 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key
   (kbd "C-c s")
   (lambda ()
     (interactive)
     (let ((current-prefix-arg '(4)))
       (call-interactively #'shell))))
#+END_SRC
** Minor features
This config comes with balanced parentheses, brackets, braces and quotes.

Constructive feedback are always welcome!
