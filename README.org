* My default settings for emacs
The following repository contains my personal emacs configuration. 

Currently I'm attempting to turn emacs into a Java IDE and a Python IDE. 

In the future I will also be adding mySQL support to this config file but for now this will do.

** What you will need to download
if you dont have any of these make sure to download them or company will
not run as intended.
- clang :: sudo apt install clang
- cmake :: sudo apt install cmake
- libclang-dev :: sudo apt install libclang-dev 

For autocompletion in Python 3 you will need:
- elpy :: sudo pip3 install elpy
- jedi :: sudo pip3 install jedi
- rope :: sudo pip3 install rope

All the packages are being downloaded by using =use-package=.

Constructive feedback is always welcome!


* TODO's
- Fix so vterm shows in a small horizantal buffer.
- Customize vterm.
- Complete the Python language support.
