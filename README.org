* What you will need to download
if you don' have any of these make sure to download them or "company" will
not run as intended.
- clang :: sudo apt install clang
- cmake :: sudo apt install cmake
- libclang-dev :: sudo apt install libclang-dev 

For autocompletion in Python 3 you will need:
- elpy :: sudo pip3 install elpy
- jedi :: sudo pip3 install jedi
- rope :: sudo pip3 install rope

All the packages are being downloaded with =use-package=.

Because I'm currently using doom-modeline you will need to install the fonts from the package =all-the-icons= 
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts
#+end_src
